/*
 * Wattsâ€“Strogatz Small-World Graph (Plain C / WASM-friendly)
 *
 * Design goals for this header:
 * - Plain C types only: use `int` and pointers (no const/unsigned/bool).
 * - Minimal includes here; implementation includes stdlib/string.
 * - Keep a small, clear public API for building a ring lattice, rewiring,
 *   exporting edges, and basic accessors.
 *
 * Graph Model:
 *   Undirected, simple graph on n nodes labeled [0, n-1].
 *   Adjacency is stored as a single neighbors[] array with an offsets[]
 *   index into neighbors for each node:
 *
 *     neighbors[ offsets[u] ... offsets[u+1]-1 ]   => sorted neighbors of u
 *
 *   The array for each node is kept sorted so that we can use binary search
 *   to test edge existence efficiently and keep the representation simple.

 * Returns: C = (1/N) * sum(C_i) for nodes with degree >= 2.
 * Returns 0.0 if graph is NULL or has no nodes with degree >= 2.
 *
 * Algorithm: Two-pointer set intersection on sorted neighbor arrays.
 * Time complexity: O(sum of d_i^2) where d_i is degree of node i.
 * Space complexity: O(1) auxiliary space.
